This is my fourth assignment.

First we have taken the cleaned data set which we haved cleaned in task 1 
then we convert categorical data into num features.

applied standardization to the data set 


Applied Logisitic Regression 
and then visulaize roc-auc curve and find threshold


Sigmoid function make sure our output lies in the range of 0 and 1 by using sigmoid activation function. 
for ex. let us assume a critical point/value 'c'.
for all values greater than equal to 'c' it will give 1 as o/p.
for less than 'c' , it will give 0 as o/p.
